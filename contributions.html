            From 2001 to 2010, Tao was part of a well-known collaboration with James Colliander, Markus Keel, Gigliola Staffilani, and Hideo Takaoka. 
            They found a number of novel results, many to do with the well-posedness of weak solutions, for SchrÃ¶dinger equations, KdV equations, and KdV-type equations.
            Michael Christ, Colliander, and Tao developed methods of Carlos Kenig, Gustavo Ponce, and Luis Vega to establish ill-posedness of certain SchrÃ¶dinger and KdV equations for Sobolev data of sufficiently low exponents.
            In many cases these results were sharp enough to perfectly complement well-posedness results for sufficiently large exponents as due to Bourgain, Collianderâˆ’Keelâˆ’Staffilaniâˆ’Takaokaâˆ’Tao, and others. 
            Further such notable results for SchrÃ¶dinger equations were found by Tao in collaboration with Ioan Bejenaru.

            Bent Fuglede introduced the Fuglede conjecture in the 1970s, positing a tile-based characterisation of those Euclidean domains for which a Fourier ensemble provides a basis of L2.
            Tao resolved the conjecture in the negative for dimensions larger than 5, based upon the construction of an elementary counterexample to an analogous problem in the setting of finite groups.
            With Camil Muscalu and Christoph Thiele, Tao considered certain multilinear singular integral operators with the multiplier allowed to degenerate on a hyperplane, identifying conditions which ensure operator continuity relative to Lp spaces.
            This unified and extended earlier notable results of Ronald Coifman, Carlos Kenig, Michael Lacey, Yves Meyer, Elias Stein, and Thiele, among others.
            Such estimates are used in establishing well-posedness results for dispersive partial differential equations, following famous earlier work of Jean Bourgain, Kenig, Gustavo Ponce, and Luis Vega, among others.

        <strong><h1>Compressed sensing and statistics</h1><button class="zone sticy" onclick="visibilityFunction('P3', 'b3')"><h6  id="b3">ðŸ”»</h6></button></strong>
        <p id="P3">
            In collaboration with Emmanuel Candes and Justin Romberg, Tao has made notable contributions to the field of compressed sensing. 
            In mathematical terms, most of their results identify settings in which a convex optimisation problem correctly computes the solution of an optimisation problem which seems to lack a computationally tractable structure. 
            These problems are of the nature of finding the solution of an underdetermined linear system with the minimal possible number of nonzero entries, referred to as "sparsity". 
            Motivated by striking numerical experiments, Candes, Romberg, and Tao first studied the case where the matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform.
            Candes and Tao abstracted the problem and introduced the notion of a "restricted linear isometry," which is a matrix that is quantitatively close to an isometry when restricted to certain subspaces.
            They showed that it is sufficient for either exact or optimally approximate recovery of sufficiently sparse solutions. 
            Their proofs, which involved the theory of convex duality, were markedly simplified in collaboration with Romberg, to use only linear algebra and elementary ideas of harmonic analysis.
            These ideas and results were later improved by Candes.
            Candes and Tao also considered relaxations of the sparsity condition, such as power-law decay of coefficients.
            They complemented these results by drawing on a large corpus of past results in random matrix theory to show that, according to the Gaussian ensemble, a large number of matrices satisfy the restricted isometry property.
